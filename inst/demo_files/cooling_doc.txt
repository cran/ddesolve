the rate of change in cooling is proportional to the difference of tempurature
between the coffee cup and room tempurature. This can be expressed as

dy/dt ~ y - Tenv

where y is the tempurature of the cup of coffee
and Tenv is the room tempurature.
By including a cooling constant, rho, the model becomes:

dy/dt = -rho * (y - Tenv)
