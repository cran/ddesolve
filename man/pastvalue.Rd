\title{Retrieve Past Values (lags) During Gradient Calculation}

\description{
These routines provides access to variable history at lagged times.
the lagged time \code{t} must not be less than t0, nor should it be
greater than the current time of gradient calculation. The routine 
can not be directly called by a user, and will only work during the
integration process as triggered by the \code{dde} routine.
}

\usage{ 
pastvalue(t)
pastgradient(t)
}

\arguments{
\item{t}{access history at time t.}
}

\value{ vector of variable history at time t. }
